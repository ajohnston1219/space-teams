        "The Challenge",
        "While creating digital twins, we often require the interpretation of an engineering drawing that provides " +
          "a high level overview of the process flow and components. Unfortunately, while much of this data is created " +
          "digitally, there are many facilities that only keep images, rather than editable, purpose built files. " +
          "In order to use the data, we must first organize the information as a list of connections and components " +
          "in a tabular format (like a CSV).  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a computer " +
          "vision algorithm to extract all the information from these diagrams and convert it into a simple list (CSV) " +
          "of components and connections."

        The challenge is divided into two parts:<br/>
        &nbsp; Part 1 &nbsp; (Weeks 1&amp;2): &nbsp; Recognize equipment, components and labels in the diagrams.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; First Prize: $500 <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Second Prize: $250 <br/>
        &nbsp; Part 2 &nbsp; (Weeks 3&amp;4): &nbsp; Recognize all the connections between equipment/components.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; First Prize: $1000 <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Second Prize: $500 <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Third Prize: $250 <br/><br/>
        Successful teams must participate in each part of the competition. You will have two weeks to produce a model
        for each part, and you must succeed in Part 1 to advance to Part 2.

          "or some other deep learning based approach, we will only support code written in python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 using " +
          "Tensorflow 2.3, Tensorflow 1.15, or PyTorch 1.6. You are free to use any other library that we can pip install."
